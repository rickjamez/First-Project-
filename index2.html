  <p>After High School, I fell into depression for a while feeling like the helpless men in Get Out. The reason being is that my surgeon was a old lady who cared for her family and she was distracted with her father close to &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 and was not very focused on me or her job.
  I am not saying that I hold a grudge, but it is what it is. Then one day, while I was working, my friend was telling me to hop on another &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 even though i just hopped of the goverments' &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618.Before this event, I felt like my soul was "Six Feet Under"(The Weeknd) and I always felt compeletly drained from the moment I woke up every day. Once, i took &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 I was automatically &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 because that was the first time i felt alive after my surgery, and it block all the pain i was getting for my back. Even though my methods were unconventional or unethical, and i had a phase in my life where I did it often; I came back to life. While we did all those &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618, me and my friends were ditching our college classes and instead wondering the city with no purpose and &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 into places where we definitely did not belong. We would &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 into Montebello &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618, so we could &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618, &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618, and &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 their stuff. On other nights, we would also &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 into my high school’s football field &#9618&#9618&#9618 sober, so we could record songs, stay in a warm place durig the fall/winter times, and &#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618&#9618 in the box. Here is some of the music we made during that time, please take a listen and give it a like! I am super excited to work with my friends and be they fly cat manager like Princess Carolyn off of BoJack Horseman, but only when they are ready because I have “BIG DREAMS” ( Zay Profits, Ca$per, Thrax) “TO THE TOP”(Zay Profits & Ca$per)!
